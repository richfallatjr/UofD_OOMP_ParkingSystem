The University has a need to develop an Object-Oriented Parking System. Each assignment will build towards creating the parking system.

* The University has several parking lots and the parking fees are different for each parking lot.
* Customers must have registered with the University parking office in order to use any parking lot. Customers can use any parking lot. Each parking transaction will incur a charge to their account.
* Customers can have more than one car, and so they may request more than one parking permit for each car.
* The University provides a 20% discount to compact cars compare to SUV cars.
* For simplicity, assume that the Parking Office sends a monthly bill to customer and customer pays it outside of the parking system.
* Each week you will need to submit an updated Class Diagram along with the other deliverables for the assignment.
